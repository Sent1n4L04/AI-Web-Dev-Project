                <h2>How AI maintains our fitness</h2>
                <h3>Hey! The spider web of Artificial Intelligence has managed to trap a major portion of attention to it and it's forever expanding. It's omnipresent, we all use it. Be it as simple as a game of chess against your computer that you still struggle to win on easy mode or the ginormous labs and inventions of OsCorp industries in Spiderman movies, it's around you - whether you're the tech geek of your class or the clueless grandpa reciting the wars you served in at every family dinner.<br></h3>
                <h3>Now, media has always strived to plant an obstinate thought in our head - technology makes you lazy. It might be true to a certain extent but the odds of the same are severely narrow, it's an underestimation of the true potential of technology. Being the tech-nerds we are, we decided the thought needed a make-over. Computer can think, it can act and it can instruct. This very project is nothing but a horizon where technology joins hands with health and gives you an e-friend that cares about you. We introduce to you, " Fit Bot" - your pal, advisor and the only fitness trainer that you certainly won't ignore, even on the leg day, trust me.</h3>
